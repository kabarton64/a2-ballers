Here are some methods to help with creating your Diary within the main function.

Add Entry: In order to add an entry into the diary simply put "add_entry("title of entry, content of entry")" to create a new entry.

Remove Entry: If you decide to get rid of an entry enter "rem_entry("title of entry")" to remove that entry from the diary.
