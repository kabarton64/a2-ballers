Create a Diary: In order to create a diary, type in the following into the main function "(variable of your choosing) = diary(name of diary)".

Add Entry: In order to add an entry into the diary simply put "add_entry("title of entry", "content of entry")" to create a new entry.

Remove Entry: If you decide to get rid of an entry enter "rem_entry("title of entry")" to remove that entry from the diary.
